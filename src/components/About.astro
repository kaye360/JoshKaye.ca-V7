            <h3>what i do</h3>

            <p>
                Web development is always in a state of change; keeping on top of
                these changes has been an exciting hobby for me since the early
                2000's. In highschool, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript and PHP.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over time, I have created many web development projects both for myself
                and for friends and family. You may view these projects in the 
                <a href="#portfolio" class="text-secondary-500 hover:underline">portfolio</a>
                section. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I have also taken many online courses to further refine my skills. You may view 
                the more prominent ones in the 
                <a href="#education" class="text-secondary-500 hover:underline">education</a>

            <h3>a little bit about me</h3>

            <p>
                I was born and raised in Langley, BC. Between 2011 and 2023 
                I have accomplished a successful career as a Journeyman
                Electrician, wiring everything imaginable including small
                condos, apartment buildings, and industrial food production
                plants.
            </p>

            <p>
                Throughout this time, I have also developed multiple websites for myself 
                and for friends and family.
            </p>

            <p>
                I currently reside in Port Coquitlam with my wife. In my spare
                time you will find me hiking, skateboarding, snowboarding or
                searching for the perfect IPA at the nearest brewery.
